Description: Based on Jiang et al.(2022)ï¼ŒThis package provides a list of functions for replicating the data simulation portion.
    In particular, we provide corresponding functions for generating the three types of random data described in this paper,
    as well as all the estimation strategies. 
    Detailed information about the data generation process and estimation strategy can be found in Jiang et al.(2022).
